# INF5130 // Algorithmics

The INF5130 course focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms. It covers topics such as time and space complexity, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, backtracking algorithms, and NP-completeness. I explore methods like "divide and conquer" and randomized algorithms. The course also includes an introduction to information theory and Turing machines.
